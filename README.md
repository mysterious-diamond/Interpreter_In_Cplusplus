# Interpreter_In_Cplusplus
A fairly simple interpreter made in c++ that you can tweak to your liking to make your own micro 'language'

HOW TO :
Just compile the files (run "make"), then run main.cpp using your code in code.txt as input with
./main.out < code.txt
That simple.

DISCLAIMER :
THIS PROJECT IS MADE IN LINUX, FOR LINUX. IT WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS DEVICES AS IT USES LINUX EXECUTABLES.
